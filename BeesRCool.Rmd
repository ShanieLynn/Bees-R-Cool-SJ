# 1. Topic: Habitat types and bee abundance

# 2. Questions: How does bee abundance vary across Oregon? Are these patterns
# related to the different types of habitat (e.g. forests, agriculture,
# wetlands/grasslands, urban)? Are different bee species more attracted to
# one habitat over another?
# Challenge Question(s): Is there correlation between Bee abundance and
# ecosystem/habitat health?
# Could this be related to other factors such as agriculture, deforestation,
# urbanization, etc.?

# 3. Other possible data sets:
# USGS National Land Cover Database (https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/nationalland-cover-database)
# Oregon Statewide Habitat Map from Oregon Spatial Data Library
# PRISM Climate Data from OSU (https://prism.oregonstate.edu/)
